Paper can be downloaded form [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2254)
[PDF download](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2254)

simulation code can be downoaded form [github.com/mgeekmatlab](https://github.com/mgeekmatlab)

matlab code is in folder matlabcode
& program starts with main2d.m

it will save results in txt, mat,& xls file 
with name respective name specifing  L N W

few saved results are attached in folder results
in txt & xls file





MAX SAVED RESULT IN TXT FILE IS FOR L=10,N=4,W=5 

no_of_codes_formed  for this case is  16451
